Linux install

sudo python setup.py

Installs the python modules in the proper place,
however several files (sigbox.glade, config.yaml)
are placed on a different path that the application 
doesn't specs and will crash.

Until I fix this in the setup.py module
you can run to start the application:

python __init__.py
